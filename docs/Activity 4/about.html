                <p class="introduction">
                    This portfolio is a reflection of my personal journey, my progress, and my passions. It showcases my skills, experiences, and the continuous efforts I put into self-improvement. Throughout my journey, I have developed skills in web development, programming, and problem-solving. As part of my personal growth, I am always striving to learn more and improve myself, whether through new projects, courses, or challenges. Aside from my professional goals, I also enjoy hobbies that help me unwind and stay active. I love playing basketball, which keeps me fit and allows me to challenge myself physically. In my downtime, I also enjoy reading manga and manwha. It's a relaxing way to explore different worlds and stories, especially series like Solo Leveling, The Beginning After The End, Tower of God, and etc. In addition to my hobbies, I am happy to share my contact information, which includes my email and phone number, so feel free to reach out for any collaborations, inquiries, or just a friendly chat.</p>
